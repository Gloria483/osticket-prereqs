<h1>osTicket - Prerequisites and Installation</h1>
This tutorial outlines the prerequisites and installation of the open-source help desk ticketing system osTicket.<br />


<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Internet Information Services (IIS)

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10</b> (21H2)

<h2>List of Prerequisites</h2>

we need Azure Virtual Machine and Installation files which include:
- Heidi SQL
- MySQL 
- PHP manager for IIS(PHPManagerForIIS_V1.5.0.msi)
- php-7.3.8
- Rewrite Module(rewrite_amd64_en-US.msi)
- VC_redist.x86.exe
- osTicket-v1.15.8

<h2>Installation Steps</h2>
<P>To begin with, we need to create an Azure virtual machine. we have to create a resource group in my case it was "RS-A", the VM name titled "VM-osTickets" with 4 CPUs(but you can choose 2-4 CPUs). The reason why we're using a virtual machine is to protect our physical machine in case an incident happens plus VM provides several advantages over physical machines such as VMs can run multiple operating system environments on a single physical computer, saving physical space, time, and management costs. </P>

<p>
Moving Forward, connect to your newly created VM using RDP. In my case I was using MAC I had to download Microsoft RDP and to connect to it we use a public IPv4 address obtained after creating the VM then you double-click on it and provide the username and password of your VM.

<p>
In the virtue of being connected to your VM, you will have to enable IIS. Simply access the control panel then select uninstall a program. Off to the left select "Turn Windows features on or off". A list will appear then you will enable Internet Information Services.

<p>
To verify if you enabled Internet Information Services(IIS) successfully, you type "127.0.0.1" if your result looks like the picture below good job else you can always go back through the installation process and check what went wrong.

Go back into the IIS manager and enable some extensions. To do this you have to go to Sites->Default->osTicket Then double click on PHP manager. Click on "Disable or enable an extension" Enable "php_intl.dll" & "php_opcache.dll" then refresh the osTicket webserver and observe the changes "Intl Extension" should now be enabled.
